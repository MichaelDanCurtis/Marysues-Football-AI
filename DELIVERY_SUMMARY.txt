## Quick Start Examples

### Example 1: Project a Player's Week
```python
from fantasy_football_simulation import (
    ProjectionEngine, ScoringEngine, ScoringFormat
)

scoring_engine = ScoringEngine(ScoringFormat.PPR)
projection_engine = ProjectionEngine(scoring_engine)

# Get week 8 projection
mean, std = projection_engine.project_player_week(
    player=mahomes,
    week=8
)
print(f"Week 8 Projection: {mean:.2f} ± {std:.2f}")
```

### Example 2: Simulate Season Outcomes
```python
from fantasy_football_simulation import SimulationEngine

simulation_engine = SimulationEngine(league, projection_engine)

# Get playoff odds
results = simulation_engine.simulate_season(num_simulations=1000)
print(results)  # Shows playoff probability for each team
```

### Example 3: Trade Impact Analysis
```python
# Calculate season impact of trading
team.roster.remove(player_out)
team.roster.add(player_in)

new_projection = team.get_season_projection()
old_projection = previous_projection
impact = new_projection - old_projection
print(f"Trade Impact: {impact:+.1f} points")
```

### Example 4: Injury Scenario
```python
from fantasy_football_simulation import PlayerStatus

# Simulate key player injury
player.status = PlayerStatus.OUT

# Get new projections
team_projection = team.get_season_projection()
print(f"Projection without {player.name}: {team_projection:.1f}")
```

## How The System Works

### 1. Data Input
- Define players with name, position, team, status
- Set projection metrics (mean, std dev, consistency)
- Add opportunity metrics (snap %, target share)
- Organize into teams and leagues

### 2. Projections
- Generate weekly projections from baseline mean
- Adjust for recent form (4-week rolling average)
- Apply opponent difficulty multiplier
- Generate confidence intervals from consistency scores

### 3. Simulations
- Monte Carlo method: randomly sample from each player's distribution
- Run 1000+ iterations to get statistical validity
- Track wins, losses, and total points for entire season
- Calculate probabilities from simulation results

### 4. Analysis
- Compare projections to actual performance
- Identify trade opportunities
- Calculate strength of schedule
- Determine championship contenders

### 5. Prediction
- Aggregate simulations to estimate playoff odds
- Calculate championship probability
- Identify most likely outcomes
- Quantify uncertainty

## Real-World Usage Scenarios

### Pre-Draft Planning
```python
# Project teams to identify draft value
for team in league.teams:
    proj = team.get_season_projection()
    print(f"{team.owner_name}: {proj:.1f} projected points")
```

### Weekly Start/Sit Decisions
```python
# Run week simulations to compare options
week_results = simulation_engine.simulate_week(current_week, num_simulations=1000)
# Choose player with highest expected value
```

### Midseason Trading
```python
# Analyze playoff impact of trades
old_playoff_prob = original_simulation_results
# Make trade...
new_playoff_prob = simulate_season()
# Show improvement/degradation
```

### Playoff Seeding
```python
# Identify actual playoff contenders
standings = league.get_standings()
simulation_results = simulate_season()
# Compare actual record to simulation expectations
```

### Waiver Wire Priority
```python
# Find undervalued replacements
free_agents = league.get_available_players()
# Project improvement for each position
# Prioritize highest impact additions
```

## Key Metrics Explained

### Projection_Mean
The expected points per week based on:
- Season average performance
- Recent form (4-week rolling)
- Opponent difficulty adjustment
- Situational factors

### Projection_Std (Standard Deviation)
The variability around the mean showing:
- How consistent the player has been
- Width of the confidence interval
- Risk/reward profile
- Boom/bust tendency

### Floor (25th Percentile)
- Conservative estimate
- Lower bound of likely performance
- Minimum expected contribution
- Used for downside protection

### Ceiling (75th Percentile)
- Optimistic estimate
- Upper bound of likely performance
- Maximum expected contribution
- Used for upside potential

### Consistency Score (0-1)
- 0.85+: Highly reliable (low variance)
- 0.60-0.85: Moderate consistency
- <0.60: High volatility (boom/bust)

---

## Accuracy & Validation

### Expected Improvements Over Baseline
- **Excellent models**: 15-25% better than league average
- **Good models**: 5-10% improvement
- **Typical outcome**: 2-5% edge
- **Diminishing returns**: More data = marginal improvements

### Validation Approach
1. Train model on historical seasons
2. Test on unseen recent weeks
3. Cross-validate across multiple seasons
4. Compare to expert consensus
5. Track accuracy throughout season

### Reality Check
- Individual games are inherently variable
- Injuries and trades change outcomes
- Weather and schedule affect performance
- Best projections are ~60% accurate week-to-week
- Season-long trends are much more predictable

---

## Customization & Extension

### Add Custom Metrics
```python
# Define custom scoring or metrics
player.custom_metric = calculate_efficiency(player)
```

### Integrate External Data
```python
# Load from APIs (ESPN, Yahoo, NFL.com, etc.)
player.weekly_stats = api.get_player_stats(player.nfl_id)
```

### Extend with ML
```python
# Add machine learning models
from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor
model = GradientBoostingRegressor()
# Train on historical data, use for predictions
```

### Connect to Dashboards
```python
# Export data to visualization tools
results.to_csv('projections.csv')
results.to_json('projections.json')
# Create interactive dashboards with your tool of choice
```
